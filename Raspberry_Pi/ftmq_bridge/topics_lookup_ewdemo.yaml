# lookup table to convert between MQTT and FTMQ

# topics in MQTT are mapped to 256 bit integer identifiers in FTMQ
# MQTT payloads are json { "name" : value }
# FTMQ payloads are 4 bytes length, "type" property indicates how
# to interpret them
# when a message is received from the FTMQ if the "id" has a match
# in the lookup table the message payload is converted to json and
# published to the MQTT broker with its associated topic
